Public site for blackstonescripts.com and the free browser-side diagnostic tools.
Deployed as a static site (Cloudflare Pages). No server, no uploads by default: every tool parses in the browser.

```

tools/shared/crash-engine.js   artifact → v1 finding
tools/shared/finding-check.js  browser-side structural + privacy check for findings
tools/shared/minidump.js       reads module/offset/exception from a minidump (no memory regions)

tools/shared/crashhash.js      legacy crash hash algorithm (joaat + 256-word list), verified on real dumps
